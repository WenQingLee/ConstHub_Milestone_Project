## UX
---
My goal in the design is to make it as easy as possible to access information on the website.
The blue color theme was chosen to elicit trust from visitors.

For investors, I wanted to provide a brief overview of the company and its projected growth through charts and graphs.

As business owners and investors will likely be using mobile devices to view the website, a mobile first approach will be used to create the website.
* Use minimum width in media queries

Suggested to use a table format

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

## Features
---
