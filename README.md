# ConstPM Website

----
First Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

ConstPM is a fictional construction consultancy company that offers project management solutions to prospective buyers in the built evironment.

The premise of this website is to function as a digital footprint for this fictional company to:
* Have a web presence
* Let visitors learn more about the company
* Showcase its services and products

This website comprises 4 pages:

1. Homepage
2. About Us
3. Our Services
4. Contact Us

## UX
---
My goal in the design is to make it as easy as possible to access information on the website and have therefore adopted a Dashboard Information Architecture for the website.
A blue and white color theme was chosen to elicit trust from visitors and provide contrast.

This B2B website is also built for consistency and scalability with the navbars and footers replicable in each page. Each page comprise of at least one of the following: 
1. Call to Actions (cta), 
2. Information, and 
3. Testimonials to create a sense of reliability and assurance.

Where possible, the rule of three/rule of thirds is applied in the design, such as 3 main portions of the website (Header, Main, Footer, 3 testimonials, 3 subscription plans, etc).

Photos selected were to fit 3 main criteria: (1) Construction-related (2) Information Technologies (3) People

As business owners will also be using mobile devices to view the website, the website is designed to be mobile responsive


## Technologies
---
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

## Features
---
* The interval of carousel in the main page was lengthened to allow visitors more time to read the ctas. 
* Rollover media icons were added to the footers to bring life to all the pages through animation without compromising the professionalism of the site.
* The Rollover media icons reference the search results instead of the company account as this company is fictional.
* The subscribe and form buttons are meant to communicate with the backend and thus does not work when clicked.
* Form submission will check if the user inputs are in accordance with the form. 
* If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address, the 'required' attribute is added to all necessary fields.
* A google map iframe was added to the contact us page so that users may find us easier.
* All external links will open in a new tab using "target=_blank"

With reference to the initial wireframe attached, there are clearly a few features that were modified and/or was not included as a result of a number of factors such as its functionality and scope creep. In the future, I hope to include the following if it does not compromise the tone of the website:
1. Animations for the logo when the navbar is clicked.
2. Animations for mobile responsive device.
3. Include an additional webpage for projects


## Testing
---
Testing was done across multiple viewports to ensure responsiveness
W3C Markup Validation Service and HTMLHint were used to check the HTML code.
W3C CSS Validation Service and CSSLint were also used to check the CSS code.
Manual testing was employed to check the functionality of the website.


## Deployment
---
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
